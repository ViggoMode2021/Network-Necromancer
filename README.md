Network Necromancer is a PowerShell script that automates adding, removing, and connecting to networks by implementing variations of 'netsh wlan show profiles' in the backend. This script will easily clean up networks stored on a computer's NIC, export and import network based XML files, and more. For example, a user can utilize this script to move the networks stored on one computer onto another computer without manually connecting to networks and inputting passwords.
